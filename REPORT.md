# Graph Neural Networks - Comprehensive Report

## Introduction
In this project, I will first try to understand the theory behind Graphs and their use with Neural Networks. Then, in a second part, I will detail the approach used in order to make Graph Level predictions applied to Molecules Data. Finally, in a third part, I will introduce the work that has been done to implement a Graph Transformer from scratch (*complÃ©ter*)

## I - Graph Neural Network Theory

### 1 - What is a Graph ?

A **Graph** can be defined as a Data Structure where elements have nodes, and edges linking nodes between them. 

--> For example, when speaking about molecules, that can be represented with a Graph Structure, the nodes are the atoms of the modecule, and the edges are the chemical bonds linking atoms together.

Graphs are particularly useful to deal with complex interactions between particular entities, and they are widely used with social relations, text and image analysis for example.

Here are a few examples of Graphs that could be used to solve Data Science problematics.

  </tr>
</table>
</p>

From each of these images, we can deduce a Graph Structure made of Nodes and Edges to link them. For the bottom left image, even if it is not straight forward, we could link the two people by a link of type *Human*, and link the two cars with a *vehicle* link for example.


### 2 - What kind of Predictions ?

Graph Data can be used for 3 particular types of prediction tasks : 

#### *2a - Node Level Predictions* : 

It is possible to predict a missing node label from its relations with other nodes. As a straight forward example, a Carbon Dioxyde Molecule has the following Graph Structure : 

<p align="center">
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a0/Carbon_dioxide_3D_ball.png" alt="Image Alt Text" width="300"/>
</p>



Now imagine that the right hand side atom of this molecule was unknown. Then, by basic Chemistry knowledge, we can say that this atom is an Oxygen atom, as it has a double chemical bond with the Carbon atom next to it. Learning relations between nodes, the type and attributes of edges that connect them can thus help predicting a Node label.

#### *2b - Link Predictions*

Another possible task to perform is to predict if there is a link between two nodes, and also possibly predict the type of link that links them.

This type of task is very useful for social interaction analysis. Imagine we are considering social relationships between a group of people, but we do not know if two people are actually linked by, let us say, a *friendship* edge.

</p>

Then, by analysing the graph as a whole, we can make predictions about whether or not these two people are linked. Indeed, if we see that other people are linked to both of them as friends, we could think that the two people have good chances of being friends as well. 

This type of prediction can have amazing value nowadays with the role that play social media and virtual social interactions in our society.

#### *2c - Graph Level Predictions*

This type of predictions is when you wan to predict a characteristic, or a number for example, by looking at a whole known graph, its interactions and properties. For example, when dealing with Recommendation System, you can find yourslef with a graph like this :

</p>

From this clients file represented as a Graph, you can for example decide to send a promotionnal e-mail to these clients based on their preferences.

As such, Graphs can be a valuable Data Structure for many domains, and the potential of predictions has been increasing sharply with the development of Deep Learning algorithms.

In this project, we will focus on a Graph Level Prediction task.

### 3 - Neural Network Theory

#### *3a - Data Specificities*

When using Graph Data, it is important to understand the particular nature of this type of data. Besides the basic structure of a graph (nodes, edges, ...) that we discussed above, here are the specificities that make them different from classical data structures.

- First, every observation in a Graph Dataset can be of different shape and size.
Indeed, molecules for example do not contain the same number of nodes and edges. It does not prevent to analyze and predict the same feature for those graphs. 

- A Graph is also hard to vizualize, as it does not exists in a classical euclidian 2D or 3D space. However, some Python libraries allow to get 2D or 3D representations through dimensionality reduction for example. 

- A Graph also have an infinite possibility of visual representations. Indeed, two different visual representations of a graph containing identical nodes, edges and relations, but differently displayed, refer to a unique Graph observation. We will see an example of this later.

- Increasing the dimension, size and complexity of a Graph can make the analysis very hard to interpret for a human eye.

- A major concept in graph analysis is the Neigborhood, as every node are influenced by their neighborhood nodes and the relation between them. Consider the local structures alongside the global structure is key to obtain a good analysis.

In summary, a Graph is a singular type of data that needs to be well understood to best adapt the analysis to the taks that is to be performed.
